### **Summary**:

* **WLAN**: Local, high-speed wireless network (Wi-Fi), ideal for homes and offices.
* **WWAN**: Large-scale, wide-area network, often mobile (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, satellites).
* **Mesh Network**: A self-healing, decentralized network where nodes communicate directly with each other.
* **Ad-Hoc Network**: A temporary, peer-to-peer network where devices connect directly without infrastructure.
