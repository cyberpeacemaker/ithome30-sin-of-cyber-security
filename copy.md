# From Office Computers to Refrigerators at Home

We’ve seen many examples already — but **which devices can actually be hacked?**

### The simple answer:

**Almost any electronic device can be hacked**, whether or not it's labeled as “smart.”

## 🔐 What Makes a Device Hackable?

A device is **potentially hackable** if it has:

1. **A programmable or controllable component** (like a microcontroller or processor), **and**
2. **A reachable communication channel** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or even a local wired link)

> If both conditions are met, then a hacker can potentially access or manipulate the device.
