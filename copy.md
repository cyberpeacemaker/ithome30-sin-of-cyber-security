# From Office Computers to Refrigerators at Home

### What Can Actually Be Hacked?

We’ve seen many examples already — but let’s get to the core question:

### ✅ The simple answer:

**Almost any electronic device can be hacked**, whether or not it’s labeled as “smart.”

---

## 🔐 What Makes a Device Hackable?

A device is potentially hackable if it has:

1. **A programmable or controllable component** (e.g., a microcontroller or processor), **and**
2. **A reachable communication channel** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or even local wired access)

> If both conditions are met, then a hacker can potentially access or manipulate the device — sometimes even remotely.

## 📋 Commonly Hackable Devices

Here's a non-exhaustive list of everyday devices that fall into this category:

### 🖥️ Personal & Mobile Devices

* Desktop and Laptop Computers

## ❓ Why Haven’t I Heard About This?

If this is news to you, you're not alone. There are two main reasons:

### 1. **Devices Used to Be "Dumb"**

In the past, home and industrial devices used basic physical switches and had no connectivity. But in the IoT (Internet of Things) era, almost everything is becoming “smart.” That means they include processors and some form of communication — making them potentially hackable.

### 2. **Modern Hacking Is Stealthy**

Today’s hackers aren’t always trying to cause obvious damage. Instead, they aim to quietly gain control of devices for profit — and remain unnoticed. Because there's no visible damage, these intrusions often **don’t make the news**, even though they’re increasingly common.

## 🧠 Common Misconceptions

### 🧩 “I don’t use the camera or microphone — I should be safe, right?”

**Not exactly.**
Think of it like a door in your house — even if *you* never open it, the door still exists. If the feature is there, **others might still be able to access it.**

### 🛑 “Turning it off should solve the problem… right?”

**Not always.**
Unless you completely **unplug** a device or **remove its battery**, many modern electronics stay in **low-power standby mode**. This is especially true for:

* Voice-activated assistants (e.g., Alexa or Siri)
* Motion-activated devices (e.g., smart lights)

These “standby” modes are designed to listen and respond — but they can also be exploited. In some cases, even if a device appears “off,” a hacker who has gained deep access can **fake a shutdown** while continuing to capture data in the background.

---

## ⚠️ Is Hacking These Devices Actually Easy?

**Unfortunately, yes — much easier than most people think.**

Take this real-world experiment by journalist **Andrew McGill** from *The Atlantic*. He created a fake smart device and connected it to the internet. Then he waited.

> “But it came a lot sooner. It was 41 minutes. The second attempt was within 10 or 15 minutes, and the third was another 10 or 15.”\[^8]

During the infamous **Mirai botnet** attack, over **65,000 devices** were infected in less than **20 hours**, doubling approximately every **76 minutes**.

We’ll explore *why* these devices are so easy to compromise in **Chapter 3-1.d**.

## 🧨 What Can Hackers Actually Do With These Devices?

As mentioned earlier, there’s a **profitable underground market** for compromised devices. Here’s what attackers commonly use them for:

### 💣 Once They’re In, Hackers Can:

* Launch **DDoS attacks** to crash websites or services\[^5]
* Send **spam and phishing emails** at scale
* **Mine cryptocurrency** using hijacked processing power\[^11]
* Spread **malware** through local or cloud-connected networks
* **Eavesdrop** on conversations or environments (audio/video)
* **Move laterally** into more sensitive areas of a network
* Use them as **proxy nodes** to hide their true locations

> These devices may be small and low-powered, but **their value lies in numbers.** Thousands — or even millions — working together can become a powerful and nearly invisible threat.

---

### 📌 TL;DR:

> **If it connects and computes, it can be hacked — and today’s devices do both, often without you realizing it.**
