An **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** is a sophisticated and targeted cyberattack in which an attacker gains unauthorized access to a network and maintains a presence over an extended period. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, which may be opportunistic and short-lived, APTs are often carried out by well-funded and highly skilled threat actors (such as nation-states or organized cybercriminal groups).

Key characteristics of an APT include:

1. **Stealthy and prolonged**: Attackers infiltrate a system without being detected and aim to maintain long-term access, often for months or even years.
2. **Targeted**: APTs are usually aimed at high-value targets, such as government agencies, large corporations, or critical infrastructure.
3. **Multi-phase**: The attack typically unfolds in multiple stages, including initial intrusion, reconnaissance, exploitation, and data exfiltration or disruption.
4. **Advanced techniques**: APT actors use advanced tools and techniques to bypass security systems, including zero-day exploits, social engineering, and custom malware.

The goal of an APT can range from espionage (stealing sensitive data or intellectual property) to sabotage or disruption of services.
