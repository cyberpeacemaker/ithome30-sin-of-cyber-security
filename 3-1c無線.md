### **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)**

Wi-Fi is a technology that allows devices to **connect to the internet** or communicate wirelessly over a **local area network (LAN)**. It uses **radio waves** to transmit data, eliminating the need for physical wired connections.

Wi-Fi operates based on the **IEEE 802.11 standard**, which defines how devices communicate over wireless networks. It typically works in the **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz frequency bands**, with newer versions (like **Wi-Fi 6**) also utilizing **6 GHz**.

Key features of Wi-Fi:

* **Wireless connectivity** for internet and local networking.
* **High-speed data transfer**, with newer standards offering faster speeds.
* **Secure encryption** (WPA2/WPA3) to protect data.
* **Range** typically around **30 meters (100 feet)** indoors, depending on the router and environment.

Wi-Fi is now a ubiquitous part of modern life, allowing people to stay connected without being tethered to cables.

**Wi-Fi加密**

* **WEP（有線等效隱私協議）**：WEP 是無線加密的早期嘗試之一，但由於其加密強度不足以及漏洞，現在已經過時。現代網絡中已不再安全使用。

* **WPA（Wi-Fi 保護存取協議）**：WPA 改進了 WEP，通過引入更強的加密方式和動態密鑰管理來提高安全性。然而，它仍然存在一些安全漏洞，後來被 WPA2 取代。

* **WPA2**：WPA2 是當前無線安全的標準，提供強大的 AES 加密。它目前被廣泛使用，為大多數家庭和商業網絡提供卓越的保護。

* **WPA3**：WPA3 是最新的安全標準，提供更強的加密、更好的防範暴力破解攻擊的能力，並改善了公共 Wi-Fi 網絡的安全性。它是無線網絡安全的未來

### Wi-Fi Direct

### **Wi-Fi Direct**:

**Wi-Fi Direct** is a technology that allows devices to **connect directly to each other** without needing a **router** or **access point**. It is essentially a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** wireless connection, where one device can act as the **Group Owner (GO)**, while the other devices connect to it as **clients**.

Wi-Fi Direct is built on the **802.11 standard** (the same one used for regular Wi-Fi), but it adds features to enable **device-to-device communication** directly. This allows for tasks like **file sharing, gaming, streaming, or printing** without the need for a network infrastructure.

**Key Features of Wi-Fi Direct:**

* **Peer-to-Peer Connections**: Devices communicate directly, without the need for a router or hotspot.
* **High-Speed Data Transfer**: Can support speeds similar to regular Wi-Fi, allowing fast file transfers or media sharing.
* **Security**: Uses WPA2 (or WPA3) encryption, ensuring that the connection is secure.
* **Easy Setup**: Devices can discover and connect to each other easily, often through a simple pairing process.

### Example Use Cases:

* **File sharing** between smartphones or tablets.
* **Streaming media** from one device (like a phone) to another (like a smart TV).
* **Gaming** between devices, where no internet connection is required.
* **Printing** directly from a laptop to a Wi-Fi Direct-enabled printer.

### 藍芽（Bluetooth）

**Bluetooth** is a short-range **wireless communication** technology designed for connecting devices over **short distances** (typically up to **100 meters**, though most devices operate around **10 meters**). It is widely used for **personal area networks (PANs)**, where devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and accessories (such as headphones, speakers, and keyboards) communicate with each other.

Bluetooth operates in the **2.4 GHz ISM band**, a frequency range that is shared with other technologies like Wi-Fi. To minimize interference, Bluetooth uses a technique called **frequency hopping** to rapidly switch between different frequency channels, ensuring stable and secure communication.

### Key Features of Bluetooth:

* **Short-Range Communication**: Typically used for connecting devices within close proximity (up to 10-100 meters, depending on the class of the device).
* **Low Power Consumption**: Especially in **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**, designed for devices that need to run on small batteries for long periods (like fitness trackers or smartwatches).
* **Secure Pairing**: Uses **AES encryption** and secure pairing methods to ensure data privacy during communication.
* **Simple Connectivity**: Devices can easily discover and connect to each other without the need for a central hub (like a router).

### Bluetooth Versions and Profiles:

* **Bluetooth Classic (2.0, 3.0, 4.0)**: Primarily used for devices that require higher data rates, such as wireless audio (e.g., speakers, headsets).
* **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Designed for **low-power** applications, used in devices like heart rate monitors, smartwatches, and other IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
* **Bluetooth 5.0 and 5.1**: Improved range, speed, and data transfer capabilities, with BLE enhancements and support for higher-throughput applications.

### Bluetooth Profiles:

Bluetooth devices support various **profiles**, which define specific behaviors for different types of communication. Some common profiles include:

* **A2DP** (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile): For wireless audio streaming (e.g., Bluetooth headphones or speakers).
* **HFP** (Hands-Free Profile): For voice communication (e.g., Bluetooth headsets or car systems).
* **HID** (Human Interface Device): For connecting input devices like mice and keyboards.
* **GATT** (Generic Attribute Profile): Used by Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to exchange small amounts of data, like temperature readings from a sensor.

### Example Use Cases:

### **Ad-Hoc Network**:

An **Ad-Hoc Network** is a **temporary**, **peer-to-peer** wireless network where devices connect directly to each other, without relying on a central access point or router. These networks are used in situations where **immediate** communication is needed, such as during emergencies or when devices need to share data in the absence of infrastructure.

* **Key Feature**: **Spontaneous** and **dynamic** wireless connections without a centralized control point.
* **Security**: Ad-hoc networks are **highly vulnerable** to **security threats**, including **eavesdropping** and **man-in-the-middle attacks**, since they often lack robust security mechanisms.

### **Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks**:

* **Definition**: An **ad-hoc network** is a decentralized wireless network where devices communicate directly with each other, without relying on a central router or base station. These networks are temporary and can be set up quickly in response to specific needs.

* **Use Cases**:

  * **Emergency Situations**: During disasters (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes), when the infrastructure is down, ad-hoc networks can provide communication between rescuers, first responders, and victims.
  * **Military Applications**: Ad-hoc networks are used in military operations where quick, secure, and mobile communication is required.
  * **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication**: Devices like smartphones or laptops can form an ad-hoc network to share files or data directly without internet access or a Wi-Fi network.

* **Technologies**:

  * **Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)**: These networks are composed of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) that can form a temporary network without the need for infrastructure. They dynamically change as nodes move in and out of range.
  * **Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs)**: Cars can communicate with each other in real-time to share traffic information or improve safety (e.g., collision avoidance systems).

* **Challenges**:

  * **Routing Complexity**: In ad-hoc networks, routing is dynamic and must adapt as devices move, which can lead to delays and packet loss.
  * **Power Consumption**: Devices need to conserve battery life while maintaining communication, which is difficult in mobile and constantly changing networks.
  * **Security**: Since there is no central control, ensuring security in ad-hoc networks can be complex. Without proper encryption and authentication, they can be vulnerable to attacks.
