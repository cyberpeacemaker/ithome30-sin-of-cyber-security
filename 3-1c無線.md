* **Yes, cellular networks** (like 4G, 5G) *are* considered part of the broader network landscape because they transmit data and have their own security concerns.
* Traditional discussions might focus on **wired networks** (Ethernet, LAN) or **Wi-Fi**, but cellular networks are definitely relevant — especially with mobile devices, IoT, and remote connectivity becoming widespread.
* In cybersecurity, you’d consider **cellular networks** when addressing risks like interception, SIM swapping, base station spoofing, or vulnerabilities in mobile communication protocols.

## 1. **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)**

* **Origin:** Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards.
* **Timeline:**

  * **1997:** The first 802.11 standard was released, supporting up to 2 Mbps.
  * **Early 2000s:** Wi-Fi started becoming popular for local area networking, offering wireless internet access in homes, offices, and public spaces.
  * Wi-Fi focuses on **high-speed wireless local area networking (WLAN)**, connecting devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT gadgets to the internet via access points.
* **Relation to Cellular:**

  * While cellular networks cover large areas (wide-area networks), Wi-Fi typically covers smaller areas (local area networks).
  * Both transmit data wirelessly but serve different use cases: Wi-Fi is mainly for local internet access; cellular is for mobile voice and data over long distances.

     * **Definition**: Wi-Fi is a technology that allows devices to communicate wirelessly over short distances, typically within a local area network (LAN). It’s based on the IEEE 802.11 standards.
   * **Wi-Fi Evolution**: Discuss how Wi-Fi technology has evolved over the years, from **Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)** to **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)**, with improvements in speed, range, and efficiency.
   * **Wi-Fi 6 and 6E**: These new standards bring improvements in speed, capacity, and performance in crowded areas, as well as support for the **2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz** frequency bands.
   * **Wi-Fi 7**: Talk about how **Wi-Fi 7** (expected to be available soon) is set to deliver even faster speeds, lower latency, and greater efficiency.


### Birth and Early Development of Wireless Networks

**1. Late 19th Century - Birth of Wireless Communication**

* **1895:** Guglielmo Marconi successfully demonstrated the first wireless telegraphy system, transmitting Morse code signals over long distances without wires.
* **1897:** Marconi established the first wireless communication company, and soon wireless telegraphy became widely used for ship-to-shore communication.

**2. Early 20th Century - Radio Broadcasting and Mobile Telephony**

* **1901:** Marconi transmitted the first transatlantic wireless signal.
* **1920s:** The rise of radio broadcasting began; wireless networks for audio communication gained popularity.
* **1940s:** Introduction of mobile radio telephone systems (primitive mobile wireless telephony).
#### 2. **Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**

* **Origin:** Bluetooth was designed for short-range wireless communication between devices.
* **Timeline:**

  * **1994:** The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was founded.
  * **1999:** Bluetooth 1.0 was introduced.
  * **2010:** BLE was introduced as part of Bluetooth 4.0, optimized for very low power consumption and used in devices like fitness trackers, smartwatches, and sensors.
* **Purpose:**

  * Bluetooth is mainly for **device-to-device communication over short distances** (around 10 meters for classic BT, more for BLE).
  * BLE focuses on battery efficiency, enabling IoT and wearable devices to operate for long periods without frequent charging.
* **Relation to Cellular and Wi-Fi:**

  * Bluetooth is **not designed for internet connectivity**, but for personal area networks (PANs).
  * Wi-Fi and cellular handle internet/data access; Bluetooth handles peripheral connections and local device communication.


### 🔹 Wireless & IoT

* **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)** – wireless LAN
* **Bluetooth** – short-range communication

### 1. **Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks**:

* **Definition**: An **ad-hoc network** is a decentralized wireless network where devices communicate directly with each other, without relying on a central router or base station. These networks are temporary and can be set up quickly in response to specific needs.

* **Use Cases**:

  * **Emergency Situations**: During disasters (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes), when the infrastructure is down, ad-hoc networks can provide communication between rescuers, first responders, and victims.
  * **Military Applications**: Ad-hoc networks are used in military operations where quick, secure, and mobile communication is required.
  * **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication**: Devices like smartphones or laptops can form an ad-hoc network to share files or data directly without internet access or a Wi-Fi network.

* **Technologies**:

  * **Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)**: These networks are composed of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) that can form a temporary network without the need for infrastructure. They dynamically change as nodes move in and out of range.
  * **Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs)**: Cars can communicate with each other in real-time to share traffic information or improve safety (e.g., collision avoidance systems).

* **Challenges**:

  * **Routing Complexity**: In ad-hoc networks, routing is dynamic and must adapt as devices move, which can lead to delays and packet loss.
  * **Power Consumption**: Devices need to conserve battery life while maintaining communication, which is difficult in mobile and constantly changing networks.
  * **Security**: Since there is no central control, ensuring security in ad-hoc networks can be complex. Without proper encryption and authentication, they can be vulnerable to attacks.

## Encryption


* **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**: WEP was one of the first attempts at wireless encryption but is now obsolete due to its weak encryption and vulnerabilities. It’s no longer safe to use in modern networks.

* **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**: WPA improved upon WEP by introducing stronger encryption and dynamic key management. However, it still had some security flaws and was later replaced by WPA2.

* **WPA2**: WPA2 is the current standard for wireless security, providing strong encryption with AES. It’s widely used today and offers excellent protection for most home and business networks.

* **WPA3**: WPA3 is the latest security standard, providing even stronger encryption, better protection against brute-force attacks, and improved security for public Wi-Fi networks. It’s the future of wireless network security.
