* **Yes, cellular networks** (like 4G, 5G) *are* considered part of the broader network landscape because they transmit data and have their own security concerns.
* Traditional discussions might focus on **wired networks** (Ethernet, LAN) or **Wi-Fi**, but cellular networks are definitely relevant — especially with mobile devices, IoT, and remote connectivity becoming widespread.
* In cybersecurity, you’d consider **cellular networks** when addressing risks like interception, SIM swapping, base station spoofing, or vulnerabilities in mobile communication protocols.

## 1. **Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)**

* **Origin:** Wi-Fi is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards.
* **Timeline:**

  * **1997:** The first 802.11 standard was released, supporting up to 2 Mbps.
  * **Early 2000s:** Wi-Fi started becoming popular for local area networking, offering wireless internet access in homes, offices, and public spaces.
  * Wi-Fi focuses on **high-speed wireless local area networking (WLAN)**, connecting devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT gadgets to the internet via access points.
* **Relation to Cellular:**

  * While cellular networks cover large areas (wide-area networks), Wi-Fi typically covers smaller areas (local area networks).
  * Both transmit data wirelessly but serve different use cases: Wi-Fi is mainly for local internet access; cellular is for mobile voice and data over long distances.


### Birth and Early Development of Wireless Networks

**1. Late 19th Century - Birth of Wireless Communication**

* **1895:** Guglielmo Marconi successfully demonstrated the first wireless telegraphy system, transmitting Morse code signals over long distances without wires.
* **1897:** Marconi established the first wireless communication company, and soon wireless telegraphy became widely used for ship-to-shore communication.

**2. Early 20th Century - Radio Broadcasting and Mobile Telephony**

* **1901:** Marconi transmitted the first transatlantic wireless signal.
* **1920s:** The rise of radio broadcasting began; wireless networks for audio communication gained popularity.
* **1940s:** Introduction of mobile radio telephone systems (primitive mobile wireless telephony).
#### 2. **Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**

* **Origin:** Bluetooth was designed for short-range wireless communication between devices.
* **Timeline:**

  * **1994:** The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was founded.
  * **1999:** Bluetooth 1.0 was introduced.
  * **2010:** BLE was introduced as part of Bluetooth 4.0, optimized for very low power consumption and used in devices like fitness trackers, smartwatches, and sensors.
* **Purpose:**

  * Bluetooth is mainly for **device-to-device communication over short distances** (around 10 meters for classic BT, more for BLE).
  * BLE focuses on battery efficiency, enabling IoT and wearable devices to operate for long periods without frequent charging.
* **Relation to Cellular and Wi-Fi:**

  * Bluetooth is **not designed for internet connectivity**, but for personal area networks (PANs).
  * Wi-Fi and cellular handle internet/data access; Bluetooth handles peripheral connections and local device communication.

無線網路消除了物理的限制，然而這也意味物理上的防禦消失了，只要在訊號範圍內，任何人都可以接受到

沒有使用線相連，將永遠不知道連接對象。外人接入，接入到外人

上述問題將隨著殭屍網路的盛行被進一步放大，本來唯一限制的是地理空間區域，內網將不再是內網
