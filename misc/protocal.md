Yes, you’re absolutely right! Communication protocols operate at different layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, and that’s where the confusion might come from. The OSI model has **7 layers**, and each layer has its own role in the data communication process. Here's a quick breakdown to clarify:

### **OSI Model Layers**

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: Deals with end-user application data.
2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: Responsible for data format translation, encryption, etc.
3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: Manages sessions and connections.
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Ensures reliable data transfer and error correction.
5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Handles routing and addressing (e.g., IP addresses).
6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Deals with physical addressing and error detection on local networks (e.g., Ethernet).
7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Concerned with the transmission of raw bits over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio waves).

### Now, let’s categorize the protocols based on their OSI layer:

---

### **1. Application Layer (Layer 7)**:

These protocols interact directly with user applications. They provide services like file transfer, email, web browsing, etc.

* **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for web browsing.
* **FTP/SFTP**: Used for file transfer.
* **SMTP**: Used for sending emails.
* **IMAP/POP**: Used for receiving emails.
* **MQTT**: Used for lightweight messaging (especially for IoT).
* **CoAP**: Similar to HTTP but designed for constrained environments (IoT).

---

### **2. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**:

These protocols ensure the end-to-end communication, reliability, and flow control.

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data (connection-oriented).
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides faster, but less reliable, communication (connectionless).
* **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**: Although RDP is typically considered at the **Application Layer**, it uses **TCP** as the transport protocol for delivering remote desktop services.

---

### **3. Network Layer (Layer 3)**:

These protocols are responsible for routing data across the network and logical addressing.

* **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Handles routing and addressing.
* **ICMP**: Used for diagnostics (e.g., **ping**).
* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.

---

### **4. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**:

These protocols manage communication over a physical link between devices on a local network.

* **Ethernet**: A widely used LAN technology.
* **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**: Used for direct communication between two nodes.

---

### **5. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**:

This layer is all about the actual transmission of raw bits over the medium.

* **Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth**: These protocols describe how data is physically transmitted over wires or wirelessly.
* **Zigbee**: A wireless protocol for low-power, low-data-rate communication, often in IoT.

---

### **Summary of Layers and Protocols**:

* **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, MQTT, CoAP.
* **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: TCP, UDP, RDP (depends on context).
* **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: IP, ICMP.
* **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: Ethernet, PPP.
* **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee.

---

So, **HTTP/HTTPS**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, and **MQTT** are **Application Layer** protocols that handle specific services (e.g., web browsing, file transfer). Meanwhile, **TCP** and **UDP** are **Transport Layer** protocols that ensure the reliability and delivery of data.

Let me know if this clears things up, or if you'd like more detailed examples!
