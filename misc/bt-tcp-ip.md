Excellent follow-up ‚Äî and you‚Äôre asking the right kind of question. Let's clarify this by breaking it into **two parts**:

## ‚úÖ **Does Wi-Fi use TCP/IP?**

### **Yes ‚Äì but not always.**

### ‚úîÔ∏è When Wi-Fi is used to connect to a **normal network or the internet**, it **almost always uses TCP/IP**:

* Devices like laptops, phones, and smart TVs use **Wi-Fi** to access a **Wi-Fi router**.
* That router connects them to a **local network** and often the **internet**.
* In this setup, **Wi-Fi is just the physical & link layer** (Layer 1 & 2), while **TCP/IP operates on top** (Layers 3 & 4).

> So in 99% of everyday cases (like browsing the web, watching YouTube, sending email), **Wi-Fi is the "road," and TCP/IP is the "vehicle"** carrying your data.

## ü§î **Is it absolute? Always TCP/IP over Wi-Fi?**

### ‚ùå No ‚Äì not always.

Some **Wi-Fi-based direct device-to-device communication** **may bypass TCP/IP**, depending on the protocol stack being used. Here's how:

---

### üîÑ **Examples where TCP/IP is not strictly required:**

### 1. **Wi-Fi Direct**

* Allows two devices to connect directly without a router.
* **Can use TCP/IP**, but **doesn't have to**.
* Example: A phone printing wirelessly to a printer using Wi-Fi Direct. Some apps use **proprietary protocols** on top of the link, not standard IP.

### 2. **Miracast (Screen casting over Wi-Fi)**

* Often uses **Wi-Fi Direct** underneath.
* The protocol stack doesn't rely on full TCP/IP ‚Äì it may use **low-level transport like UDP or vendor-specific streaming protocols**.

### 3. **Wi-Fi Aware (Neighbor Awareness Networking)**

* A newer tech allowing nearby devices to discover and communicate **without an internet connection**.
* It may use **low-overhead protocols** instead of standard IP-based communication.

### 4. **IoT Devices Using Wi-Fi**

* Some IoT frameworks (like ESP-NOW from Espressif for ESP32 chips) use **Wi-Fi radios**, but **bypass TCP/IP**, using their own **custom lightweight protocol**.

## üß± Layer Summary:

| OSI Layer | Wi-Fi Provides                                        | TCP/IP Provides                 | Example                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1 & 2     | Wi-Fi (802.11) = physical + link (MAC, channel, etc.) | ‚Äî                               | Raw wireless connection               |
| 3         | ‚Äî                                                     | IP (addressing/routing)         | IP address assignment                 |
| 4         | ‚Äî                                                     | TCP/UDP (reliability/streaming) | Reliable data (e.g., a web request)   |
| 7         | ‚Äî                                                     | HTTP, FTP, etc.                 | Applications (e.g., browser, printer) |

## ‚úÖ So in Summary:

* **Wi-Fi = link layer (not application or transport layer)**.
* **TCP/IP runs on top** of Wi-Fi **in most normal uses** (web browsing, streaming, apps).
* **Direct device-to-device** (like Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast, or IoT) **can bypass TCP/IP**, using simpler or custom protocols.

If you're building an app or working on embedded systems, **you can technically use Wi-Fi without TCP/IP**, but it's usually easier and more interoperable to use the standard TCP/IP stack.
