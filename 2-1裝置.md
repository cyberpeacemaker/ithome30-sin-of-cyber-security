# 【07】資安的原罪 ch.2-1 從辦公電腦到智慧家電

# From Office Computers to Refrigerators at Home

We’ve seen many examples already — but **which devices can actually be hacked?**

### The simple answer:
**Almost any electronic device can be hacked**, whether or not it's labeled as “smart.”[^4]

## 🔐 What Makes a Device Hackable?

A device is **potentially hackable** if it has:

1. **A programmable or controllable component** (like a microcontroller or processor), **and**
2. **A reachable communication channel** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or even a local wired link)

> If both conditions are met, then a hacker can potentially access or manipulate the device remotely.
 
belowe is brief common list:

### 🖥️ Personal & Mobile Devices

* Office & Home Computers (Desktops, Laptops)
* Smartphones & Tablets
* Voice Assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
* Wireless Earbuds & Headphones

### ⌚ Wearables

* Smartwatches
* Fitness Trackers

### 🌐 Network & Communication Devices

* Wi-Fi Routers & Home Gateways
* Modems, Network Switches
* NAS (Network-Attached Storage)

### 📺 Home Appliances (家電)

* Baby Monitors, 智慧市話
* Intercoms, Smart Doorbells
* Speakers, Bulbs, Thermostats 窗簾
* TVs, Streaming Sticks, Set-Top Boxes
* Plugs & Switches
* Refrigerators (冰箱)
* Washing Machines (洗衣機), Dryers (烘衣機)
* Microwave Ovens (微波爐), Toasters (烤麵包機), Ovens (烤箱)
* Smart Toilets (電動馬桶)
* 空調，運動器材及無線體重器

### 🖨️ Office & Surveillance Equipment

* Network Printers & Scanners
* CCTV Cameras
* Alarm Systems (警報器)

### 🚗 Vehicles & Transport

* Smart Cars (with onboard systems or connectivity)
* Ships & Cargo Vessels (貨輪貴), Superyachts (超級遊艇)
* Drones
* Surveillance Robots

### 🏥 Industrial & Medical Systems

* Medical Devices (e.g., insulin pumps, pacemakers)
* 工地的吊臂起重機
* Walkie-talkies
* SCADA Systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
* PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)
* Wind Turbines (風力發電機)
* 電腦晶片控制城市的交通 複雜的工業生產流程
* 電梯裡的緊急電話


## Why Didn't I Know / Heard This Before?

Besides probably not paying attention to these kinds of news, a more likely reason is that times have changed — and two things are happening simultaneously.

one is, In the past, home appliances (家電) were simple using physical switches to cotrol and without the ability to communicate with other devices. But now, in the era of IoT (Internet of Things), everything is becoming "smart." That usually means devices have programmable components and are connected to the internet (or at least to other devices). which is exactly what makes them possible to under hacking.

Another important change is the nature of hacking itself. It’s no longer just about causing trouble or making a scene. There’s now a huge, profitable underground market for discreet, persistent control over devices. The goal is to access or control your devices without you ever noticing. without causing direct, visible, effects to regular people, they don’t make the news. So it quietly flies under the radar.

## Other Things You Probably Don’t Know Either

### It’s Okay If I Didn’t Use the Function… Right?

“I didn’t use the camera, the microphone, or connect it to the internet — so I should be safe, right?”

**Not exactly.**

It’s like having a door in your house. Even if *you* never use it, the door still exists — and that means *other people* could potentially use it. Just because you ignore those features doesn’t mean they can’t be accessed by someone else.

### Turning It Off Should Solve the Problem… Right?

**Not necessarily.**

Unless you physically unplug the device or remove its battery, there’s no guarantee that it’s truly “off.” Many modern devices don’t fully shut down — they just enter **low-power standby mode** when you press the power button.

Many IoT devices are designed to keep certain sensors — like microphones or cameras — on standby, listening for wake words or detecting motion.
**Examples:** voice-activated assistants (聲控喚醒), motion-sensor lights (電燈自動偵測開燈).

These features are **built-in by design**, but they can also be **exploited by hackers**.

Even if there’s no official “listening mode,” a skilled hacker who gains access to the **device’s kernel or firmware** can make it *pretend* to be off — while it quietly continues to operate in the background, capturing audio, video, or other data **without your knowledge,** like real-world examples of this\[^10].

## So These Devices *Can* Be Hacked — But Is It Easy?

**Unfortunately, yes — it’s easier than most people think.**

Let’s take a look at an actual example. Andrew McGill, a reporter at *The Atlantic*, ran an experiment to test how vulnerable devices are to hacking. He set up a fake smart device and waited:

> “But it came a lot sooner. It was 41 minutes. \[The second attempt was] within 10 or 15 minutes, \[and the third was] another 10 or 15.”\[^8]

And during the *Mirai* botnet outbreak, over **65,000** devices were infected in less than **20 hours**, doubling roughly every **76 minutes**.

We’ll dive deeper into *why* IoT devices are so easy to hack in **Chapter 3-1.d**.

## How on Earth Would They Hack These Devices?

As mentioned earlier, there’s a **huge and profitable underground market** for hacked devices. We’ll dive into the technical details in **Chapter 3-2.d**, but here’s the short version:

The main goal is to build the **largest botnet possible** — not just from traditional IT systems, but increasingly from **IoT devices**, which are usually much easier to compromise\[^6].

Why? Because once a hacker controls thousands (or even millions) of these devices, they can:

* Launch **DDoS attacks** (Distributed Denial of Service), overwhelming websites or services with traffic until they crash\[^5]
* Send out **spam or phishing emails** at scale, making it harder to trace the source
* **Mine cryptocurrency** using the collective processing power of thousands of small devices [^11]
* Distribute **malware** through infected networks or connected devices
* **Spy** or quietly collect data from homes and offices — such as audio, video, or environmental data\[^3]\[^9]
* **Pivot** into more sensitive parts of a network — using a compromised IoT device as a *stepping stone* to attack other, better-protected systems\[^1]\[^2]
* Act as **proxy command-and-control (C2) nodes**, helping attackers hide their real location and identity

The individual devices don’t need to be powerful. Their **real value lies in scale** — thousands of low-power devices acting together can form a powerful and hard-to-detect weapon.
