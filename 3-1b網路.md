### 🌍 1960s – The Foundations

1960 一個軍用通訊網路要怎麼打造出來 才能撐過核子攻擊
* **ARPANET (1969)**: Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense via **ARPA**, ARPANET was the first network to use **packet switching**—a method of breaking data into packets and sending them independently.
* The first successful message was sent between UCLA and Stanford on **October 29, 1969**.

### 🔧 Technologies that Made It Possible

* **Packet Switching**: Developed by Paul Baran and Donald Davies.
* **TCP/IP Protocol (1970s-80s)**: Created by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. Became the standard for data transmission in **1983**, replacing older protocols.

### 1980s – From ARPANET to Internet

* The term **"Internet"** starts being used to describe interconnected networks using TCP/IP.
* **NSFNET (1986)**: A network developed by the National Science Foundation, which connected more universities and research centers, forming the backbone of the modern Internet.

## 🌐 3. **Birth of the World Wide Web (WWW)**

### 👨‍💻 Inventor: **Tim Berners-Lee** (1989–1991)

* Working at **CERN**, he proposed a system to link documents using **hypertext**.
* Developed three core technologies:

  * **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language)
  * **URI/URL** (Uniform Resource Identifier/Locator)
  * **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

### 🎉 1991: WWW is Released to the Public

* This was the start of the **modern web**, where users could click on links to move between documents on different servers.

## Rise of Web Browsers

### 1993: **Mosaic**

* The first widely used graphical web browser.
* Developed by **Marc Andreessen** and others at the **NCSA** (National Center for Supercomputing Applications).
* It made the web accessible to non-technical users.

### Netscape Navigator (1994)

* Based on Mosaic, became very popular.
* Led to the "Browser Wars" of the late 1990s with Microsoft.

### Internet Explorer (1995)

* Released by Microsoft and bundled with Windows.
* Eventually dominated the browser market for a decade.

session機制 cookies, token
    HTTP is stateless — each request is independent.

    Sessions create state — by assigning a unique ID to a user.

    This ID is stored on the client (usually in a cookie) and sent with each request.

    On the server side, the session ID maps to stored data (login status, preferences).

    Can mention how sessions expire (timeouts or logout).

## 協定 Internet related
* **1960s–70s**: Foundation protocols (NCP, then TCP/IP)
* **1980s**: Standardization of FTP, Telnet, DNS, SMTP, POP
* **1990s**: Explosion of web-based protocols (HTTP, SSL, IMAP, DHCP)
* **2000s–2020s**: Security (HTTPS, SFTP, SSH) and speed (HTTP/2, HTTP/3, QUIC)


## encryption
about **network encryption** in a wired environment, **IPsec** or **TLS/SSL** would be the typical solutions, not WEP.

## 新威脅
### Dark Web 1990s:

Explain it as part of the deep web — sites not indexed by search engines.

Focus on Tor network and how it enables anonymous communication.

Mention legitimate uses (privacy, activism) and risks (illegal activities).

2002 Tor(The Onion Router)

### Blockchain and Bitcoin 2010s:

Introduce blockchain as a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger.

Explain Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, built on blockchain tech.

Briefly touch on how blockchain challenges traditional centralized systems (banks, governments).

### 3. **Dark Web**:

* **Definition**: The **Dark Web** is a small part of the **Deep Web** (not indexed by search engines), where websites are hidden and can only be accessed via **special software** like **Tor** (The Onion Router).

* **How it Works**:

  * The Dark Web uses **Tor** to anonymize users' internet traffic by routing data through multiple layers of encryption and randomly distributed servers.
  * **.onion** domains are used for these sites. These websites are not indexed by traditional search engines, making them much harder to find without the right tools.

* **Use Cases**:

  * The Dark Web has a **reputation for illegal activities** (e.g., illicit marketplaces, drugs, weapons), but it also provides an important platform for **privacy-conscious individuals** like journalists and whistleblowers.
  * **Freedom of Speech**: It's sometimes used to bypass censorship in authoritarian regimes, allowing users to access information freely.

* **Dark Web vs. Deep Web**: Explain that the **Deep Web** includes things like private databases, online banking, and academic journals that are not searchable by standard browsers but are legal and legitimate. The **Dark Web** is a subset of the Deep Web with anonymity at its core.

### 4. **Blockchain**:

* **Definition**: **Blockchain** is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that prevents alteration or fraud.

* **How it Works**:

  * It works by storing data in **blocks** that are linked together (hence the "chain" in blockchain). Each new block contains a timestamp and a reference to the previous block.
  * **Decentralization**: There is no central authority controlling the blockchain. Instead, it relies on a network of participants (or **nodes**) to validate and maintain the ledger.

* **Applications**:

  * **Cryptocurrencies**: Blockchain is the foundation of digital currencies like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**.
  * **Smart Contracts**: Used for self-executing contracts (e.g., on Ethereum), where actions are triggered automatically when conditions are met.
  * **Supply Chain**: Blockchain can be used to track the authenticity and journey of products in supply chains.

---

### 5. **Bitcoin (Cryptocurrencies)**:

* **Definition**: **Bitcoin** is the first and most well-known **cryptocurrency**, a type of digital or virtual currency that uses **blockchain** for secure transactions and operates independently of central banks or governments.

* **How it Works**:

  * Bitcoin uses **mining** to validate transactions. **Miners** use computational power to solve complex problems, which adds new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain and ensures its security.
  * Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the **blockchain** and are transparent, but **pseudonymous**, meaning transactions are publicly visible but not tied to any individual’s real-world identity.

* **Benefits of Bitcoin**:

  * **Decentralization**: No central authority like a government or bank controls Bitcoin.
  * **Borderless**: It can be sent and received anywhere globally, making it attractive for international transactions.
  * **Security**: Transactions are secure and irreversible once recorded on the blockchain.

* **Challenges**:

  * **Scalability**: Bitcoin’s transaction speed can be slow, especially during periods of high demand.
  * **Energy Consumption**: Bitcoin mining consumes significant computational power and energy, raising environmental concerns.
  * **Regulation**: Governments are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, and their future is still uncertain.
