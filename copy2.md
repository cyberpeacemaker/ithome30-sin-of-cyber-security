Let’s break down **“Security Auditing”** and the **“Threat Modeling Process”**, both of which are essential components of cybersecurity and software/system security practices.

## 🧠 **2. Threat Modeling Process**

### ✅ **Definition:**

**Threat modeling** is a proactive process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential security threats or vulnerabilities in a system **before** they are exploited.

### 🎯 **Purpose:**

* Understand potential threats early in the design or development phase.
* Prioritize security controls based on potential risks.
* Minimize attack surface.

### 🔄 **Steps in the Threat Modeling Process:**

#### 1. **Define the System**

* Understand and document what you're trying to protect (e.g., app architecture, data flow diagrams).

#### 2. **Identify Threats**

* Use models like **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege).
* Think like an attacker: how could this system be misused?

#### 3. **Analyze Risks**

* Assess the potential impact and likelihood of each threat.
* Tools: **DREAD**, **CVSS**, or custom risk scoring.

#### 4. **Define Mitigations**

* Propose countermeasures for each identified threat.
* E.g., input validation, access controls, encryption, monitoring.

#### 5. **Review & Revise**

* Threat modeling is not a one-time activity—update it when systems change.

### 🔁 **How They Work Together:**

* **Threat modeling** is **proactive** — used during **design** and development.
* **Security auditing** is **reactive** — used after systems are deployed to **verify** security posture.

Both are essential to maintaining robust security over the system lifecycle.
