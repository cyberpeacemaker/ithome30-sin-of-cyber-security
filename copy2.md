Yes, introducing other protocols related to the internet after talking about the "internet, world wide web, and browsers" is definitely appropriate! It helps build a deeper understanding of how the internet functions. After covering the basics of how we access the web, you can expand into the protocols that power it behind the scenes.

Here are a few protocols you might want to introduce:

### 1. **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol / Secure)**

* These are the protocols used for transferring web pages.
* **HTTPS** is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect the data.

### 2. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**

* The foundational protocols for the internet, responsible for ensuring data is delivered accurately from one place to another.

### 3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**

* DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. It converts human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.

### 4. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

* Used for transferring files over the internet. It's essential for uploading files to web servers, for example.

### 5. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

* The protocol that handles sending emails.

### 6. **POP3/IMAP (Post Office Protocol / Internet Message Access Protocol)**

* These protocols are used for retrieving email from a mail server.

### 7. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

* This protocol assigns IP addresses to devices on a network automatically.

### 8. **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)**

* Protocols used to secure communication over networks, ensuring encryption of data, especially during transactions (like with HTTPS).

By introducing these protocols, you'll give your audience a more complete picture of how the internet operates from the ground up. Each of these protocols plays a critical role in making the internet work smoothly, so itâ€™s a good progression after discussing browsers and the web.

Would you like help in structuring your explanation or more details on any of these protocols?
